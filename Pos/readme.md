This little library is for examining the positions of two game
objects and detecting whether they are within a range of each other.

Objpos.e has two routines.
The one you will want to use is in_region.
i_region() is a new method I made up.  It works but it is slower.
You can use compare.ex to see what I mean.

For more of an explanation of how to use in_region, view the source
code in objpos.e  A full explanation is given.
